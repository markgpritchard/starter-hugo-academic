I am a public health registrar in the Thames Valley and a DPhil (PhD) student modelling infectious disease dynamics at the University of Oxford. 
{style="text-align: left;"}

I joined the [Thames Valley public health programme](https://www.oxsph.org/) in 2017. I was interested in using academic research to improve the evidence base for public health action but was unsure what route would best suit my interests. When the covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020 I split my time between working with the local Public Health England health protection team and helping the research effort via the [International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infection Consortium](https://isaric.org/) out of the University of Oxford. The early months of the pandemic made clear the importance of reaching sound evidence-based approaches in the absence of extensive experimental data. After a brief return to local authority public health during which I worked on local implementation of rapid testing for covid-19, I started my PhD in the summer of 2021.
